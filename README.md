## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install` inside the directories `/frontend` and `/backend`.
To run the demo app, you'll need to open up a second terminal to run both the backend and the frontend servers at the same time on your local computer.

To run the servers

## [Frontend] Running Webpack Development Server

```sh
cd frontend
npm start
```

## [Backend] Running Backend Server

The app's database will need to be setup on your local computer to run. There's a quick read me to set it up in the backend folder.

```sh
cd backend
npm start
```
